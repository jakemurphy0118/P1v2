This simulation investigates how far positrons will penetrate blocks of aerogel until losing all kinetic energy.  The source is a disk of Na-22 with thin sheets of Kapton foil above and below.  Above the foil is 5 micrometers of polyvinyltoluene plastic scintilator followed by the 1x1x1 cm cube of aerogel.
